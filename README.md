* sir i am still learning how to use latext and Github, i have so far not been able to insert LaTex.
* Also my latex files are showing up a bunch of erros which adds to the overwhelming errors that i am previously dealing with the RTL generation using Vivado HLS.
* For Syncing Overleaf with Github, they require registration and verification of bank credentials which i have refrained from doing so.
